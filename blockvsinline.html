        <h1>Block vs. Inline Elements</h1>
        <p>This paragraph is made with the p element which is a block element.</p>
        <div>This section is made with the div element which is also a block element. Sections of the webpage can be styled uniquely with div. Other block elements include h1-h6, ol, ul, table, li, etc.</div>
        <div style="background-color: aqua;">This section uses div to style it differently from the other sections.</div>
        <p>Inline elements only take up as much space as is necessary and do not start on a new line. For example, <span style="font-weight: bold;">this is an inline element using span with a unique style.</span> Other inline elements are a, abbr, cite, map, img, etc. While a block element can contain an inline element, an inline element cannot have a block element within it. </p>
