        </p> <blockquote cite="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/un-busy/">
            It is a decision we make. We are never forced into a lifestyle of busyness. The first, and most important, step to becoming less busy is to simply realize that our schedules are determined by us. We do have a choice in the matter. We donâ€™t have to live busy lives.
