        <h2>Entities, Symbols, and Emojis</h2>
        <p>
            Some characters are reserved in html so character entities must be used. 
            See the examples below.
        </p>
        <p>3 &lt 4</p>
        <p>4 &gt 3</p>
        <p>
            A non-breaking space is used so that characters will stay together 
            rather than being broken when a new line starts. See below. 
        </p>
        <p>10&nbspkm/h</p>
        <!--In XHTML, empty elements must always be closed such as the break below.-->
        <p>
            Greek letters are supported by HTML by using entities. 
            For example, &Delta; <br />
            Many other symbols are also supported. 
            For example, &rarr; &larr; &uarr; &darr; 
        </p>
        <p>Emojis are also displayed using codes. &#128516</p>
